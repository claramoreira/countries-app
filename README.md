# Countries App

This is a very simple React App created to consume the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) and practice some React and JavaScript basics. Also, a great opportunity to explore some more CSS to get the website to look good. 

Obs: a lot has to be done for this to look good in a smaller screen. :sweat_smile:
